Questions - 

1. Write an ALP to multiply the contents of memory location 3040H by the contents of
memory location 3041H and store the result in memory locations 3042H and 3043H with
LS byte of the product at memory location 3042H. Draw also the flow chart. (Hint: Shift
and Add method)
2. Five data bytes are stored in memory location C001H to C005H. Count number of
ones in each byte and store this count in corresponding memory locations D001H to
D005H.
3. An array of data bytes is stored beginning from memory location 2001H. Length of
this array is stored in location 2000H. Find largest number of the array and store it in
memory location 3000H.
4. Ten 8-bit signed numbers are stored in memory locations beginning from 8000H.
Move all negative numbers in memory locations beginning from 9000H.Count all
positive numbers.
5. An array of ten data bytes is stored on memory locations 2100H onwards. Write an
8085 assembly language program to find the bytes having complemented nibbles (e.g.
2DH, 3CH, 78H etc.) and store them on a new array starting from memory locations
2200H onwards.
6. An array of twenty data bytes is stored on memory locations 4100H onwards. Write an
8085 assembly language program to remove the duplicate entries from the array and store
the compressed array on a new array starting from memory locations 4200H onwards.
7. Write an 8085 assembly language program to count the number of bytes that are
greater than 2510 and lesser than 6510 from an array of twenty bytes stored on memory
locations 2000H onwards. Store such numbers on memory locations 2100H onwards.
8. Write ALP for the following. : Two ASCII strings start at memory locations 1042H
and 1052H respectively. Memory location 1041H contains the length of the strings. The
program sets the memory location 1040H to 00H, if the strings are equal and to FFH if
they are not.
9. A set of ten BCD numbers are stored in memory locations starting from 2500H. Write
an ALP to convert each BCD number to binary hex number and store the result in
memory locations starting from address 4000H.
10. Write a program to remove all 00H from given block of 15 data bytes.After that
perform addition of all the numbers.If carry is generated then maintain the carry also.
